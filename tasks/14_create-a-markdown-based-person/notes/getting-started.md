# Getting Started with PK

PK is a personal knowledge management system that helps you build a second brain using Markdown notes.

## Core Concepts

### Notes
Notes are the building blocks of your knowledge base. Each note should focus on a single concept or idea.

### Tags
Use tags to categorize and organize your notes. Some popular tag strategies:
- By topic: #programming, #design, #business
- By status: #draft, #reviewed, #published
- By project: #project-alpha, #project-beta

### Links
Create connections between ideas using wiki-style links:
- [[Bidirectional Linking]] - Learn about linking notes
- [[Zettelkasten Method]] - Historical note-taking approach

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Create a note
pk new "My Note Title" --tag topic

# List all notes
pk list

# Search notes
pk search "keyword"

# Show note with backlinks
pk show "My Note Title"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be atomic**: One idea per note
2. **Link generously**: Connect related concepts
3. **Use descriptive titles**: Make notes searchable
4. **Tag consistently**: Develop a personal system
5. **Review regularly**: Use [[Link Validation]] to maintain quality
