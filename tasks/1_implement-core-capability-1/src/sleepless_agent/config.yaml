        Generate a task to improve the py38-cc-ds project in workspace/projects/py38-cc-ds/.

        ## Current State
        - Active tasks: {task_count} ({pending_count} pending, {in_progress_count} in progress)

        ## Available Tasks to Refine
        {available_tasks}

        ## Recent Work & Context
        {recent_work}

        ## Primary Project: py38-cc-ds
        The main project is located at workspace/projects/py38-cc-ds/. This is a Python code generation project that needs:
        - Implementation of Plan 018 (PyCode quality improvement with 7 core capabilities)
        - Testing and validation of existing code
        - Documentation improvements
        - Bug fixes and enhancements

        ## Workspace Constraints
        - Tasks execute in isolated directories: workspace/tasks/<task_id>/
        - REFINE tasks for py38-cc-ds should use -p py38-cc-ds flag
        - Do NOT reference workspace/data/ or other system directories

        ## Task Generation
        Generate ONE REFINE task for the py38-cc-ds project:
        - Implement features from Plan 018
        - Add tests or improve existing tests
        - Fix bugs or improve code quality
        - Add documentation
        - Refactor or optimize code

        IMPORTANT Format Requirements:
        - Your response MUST be 1-2 sentences max
        - Start with [REFINE] tag
        - Be specific about what to implement/improve

        Examples:
        - [REFINE] Implement the EasyOCR integration capability from Plan 018
        - [REFINE] Add unit tests for the code generation module
        - [REFINE] Improve error handling in the API endpoints

        Generate a task for the py38-cc-ds project (workspace/projects/py38-cc-ds/).

        ## Current State

        {recent_work}

        ## Primary Project: py38-cc-ds
        Python code generation project at workspace/projects/py38-cc-ds/.
        Refer to plan_018_pycode_quality_improvement.md for implementation roadmap.

        ## Workspace Constraints
        - REFINE tasks for py38-cc-ds should use -p py38-cc-ds flag
        - Do NOT reference workspace/data/ or other system directories

        ## Task Generation
        Generate ONE task (NEW or REFINE) for py38-cc-ds:
        - Implement features from Plan 018 (7 core capabilities)
        - Add tests, fix bugs, improve code quality
        - Add documentation or examples
        - Optimize or refactor existing code

        Format: [REFINE] or [NEW] followed by 1-2 sentence description.

        Generate an interesting and valuable task for the workspace.

        ## Current State
        - Active tasks: {task_count} ({pending_count} pending, {in_progress_count} in progress)
        - Few tasks in queue - good time for new projects!

        ## Available Tasks to Refine
        {available_tasks}

        ## Workspace Constraints
        - Tasks execute in isolated directories: workspace/tasks/<task_id>/
        - Each task only has access to its own workspace folder and workspace/shared/
        - Do NOT reference workspace/data/ or other system directories in task descriptions
        - REFINE tasks reuse existing task workspaces (no new folder created)

        ## Task Generation
        Generate ONE innovative task that creates value.

        Areas to explore:
        - Build practical tools and utilities
        - Create educational content and tutorials
        - Develop software applications or scripts
        - Write comprehensive documentation or guides
        - Design systems and architectures
        - Analyze and compare technologies or approaches
        - Generate creative content (technical writing, examples)
        - Research and summarize complex topics
        - Create data visualizations or analysis
        - Develop proof-of-concepts or experiments

        Can be NEW (fresh project) or REFINE (improve existing work) - choose what would be most valuable.

        IMPORTANT Format Requirements:
        - To refine a specific task: Use [REFINE:#<task_id>] followed by description
          Example: [REFINE:#3] Expand analysis with performance benchmarks
        - For general refinements: Use [REFINE] followed by description
        - For new tasks: Use [NEW] followed by description
        - Your response MUST be 1-2 sentences max
